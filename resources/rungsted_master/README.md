## Rungsted structed perceptron sequential tagger

### Building 

Use

``python setup.py build_ext --inplace``

Building with the above command happens *in place*, leaving the generated C and C++ files in the source directory for inspection. Changes in dependent modules are unfortunately not picked up by the build system. Whenever you need to start from a clean slate, use the supplied `clean.sh` script to get rid of the generated files. 

The build script requires a recent version of Cython. If you don't have Cython, it can be installed as below: 

``pip install cython``

### Demo

The repository contains a subset of the part-of-speech tagged Brown corpus. To run the structured perceptron labeler on this dataset, execute:

``python src/labeler.py --train data/brown.train --test data/brown.test.vw``

Rungsted's input format is closely modeled on the powerful and flexible format of [Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/Input-format),
with the exception that Rungsted is perfectly fine with labels that are not integers.

### Datasets

Provided you have a working installation of NLTK, you can recreate the Brown dataset with this command. 

``python rungsted/datasets/cr_brown_pos_data.py data/brown.train.vw data/brown.test.vw``

There is also a script `rungsted/datasets/conll_to_vw.py` to convert from CONLL-formatted input to Rungsted
